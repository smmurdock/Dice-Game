Pig Dice Game

The game is made up of two players.<br>
In each turn, a player rolls the dice as many time as they wish and each roll of the dice gets added to the Round score.<br>
If a player rolls a 1, their Round score is erased and it is the other player's turn.<br>
A player can roll as many time as they want and choose to 'HOLD' their score which is added to their total score.<br>
Once a player holds, it is the other player's turn.<br>
The first player to reach 100 points wins.<br>
